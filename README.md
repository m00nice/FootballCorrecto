Unless the Teams.csv does not contain enough teams or too many teams the program should run.
after each round the program create a file for that round, but if that file already exists, the program won't write to it.
Only the super liga works and the setup settings are hard coded.
If you exit the switch case during the 22 round table or the two 10 table the tables will reset.
